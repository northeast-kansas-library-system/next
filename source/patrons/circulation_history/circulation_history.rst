Next Search Catalog is set up so that, if a borrower's "Privacy" setting is set to "Default," the catalog will record every item they've checked out in the previous 13 months.

In the staff client you can see the borrower's "Privacy" setting on the details page in their account but staff **cannot** change a borrower's privacy setting.  Borrowers can only change their privacy setting in the OPAC.
