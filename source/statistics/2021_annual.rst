This spreadsheet answers the following questions for the annual state statistical survey:

#. Question 2.2a - Number of users
  - Data comes from the "Monthly statistics" spreadsheet "YTD totals tab" - column U.
  - Patrons whose accounts had been expired for more than 3 years and had no issues that would have prevented their accounts from being automatically deleted, were automatically deleted several times in 2021.  This fulfills the "Inactive patron accounts should have been purged within the past three (3) years" note added to that question.
  - The report that gathers this data counts the number of patrons in the borrowers table in the system on January 1, 2022.
  - This year, the report was generated automatically between midnight and 2:00 a.m. on January 1, 2022.
