Collection statistical analysis tools
=====================================

The following tools were designed to accompany the program "Collection development 2.0 (with Gail Santy from CKLS)" which occurs on March 25, 2021.

The general principles in stated in this program are:

- A larger collection is not necessarily a better collection
- Collections are created to meet the needs of the community
- The collection must remain relevant and useful to the library users
- Analysis provides insight into collection age, strengths, and weaknesses
- Best practices indicate an analysis should happen about every five years

The following tools are designed to help library staff easily organize and analyze statistical data from the state library annual report and from reports in Next Search Catalog.
