Hoopla searching on the OPAC
============================

Beginning in November of 2020, we are no longer loading Marc records into the catalog.  Instead we are using the new Hoopla "plugin" to allow patrons to simultaneously search our catalog and Hoopla in our OPAC.

Here's how it works:

#. Go to the OPAC and do a search
#. A few seconds after the search has completed, a box will pop-up above the OPAC search results saying "Found XX results in Hoopla"
#. If you click on the link, a window will pop up showing you results for that search from Hoopla
#. Clicking on the cover image for one of these results will take you directly to Hoopla
