5. Book-club account
  - Look up the title you want to request and click on "Hold" to place a request as normal
  - Enter a book-club category card library card number and place the reqeust as normal
  - On the request form change "Holds to place (count)" to the number of copies you require
  - ADVANGATES:
    - Easiest process
  - DISADVANTAGES:
    - If you check requested items out to the bookclub account, you will not be able to track which student has which copy
    - If you want to check items out to individual borrowers, you have to cancel the requests on each item when checking them out which can be time consuming and confusing
    - Bookclub accounts are not exempt from lost item fees, so if you check items out to the bookclub account and the items are kept overdue, the account will be blocked and billed automatically which prevents you from using it for other classes
