In the public catalog, borrowers have the ability to delete their own history and to disable circulation history for items they check out.  In the staff client you can see the borrower's "Privacy" setting on the details page in their account but staff **cannot** change a borrower's privacy setting.  Borrowers can only change their privacy setting in the OPAC.
