#. What should the best practices be for claims returned items (OTTAWA)

    - Specifically OTTAWA wanted to know about what to do when a different library marks one of your items as "Claims returned."
    - ILL rules
    - Report 2915

    ..
      Need CR reports - 1 report to identify items - 1 report to identify library where item was checked out

#. Discussion of patrons reporting claims returned (LEAVENWRTH)

    ..
      Are libraries experiencing an uptick in how often patrons are reporting material not c/in, even after quarantine is completed, and the item is found on the libraryâ€™s shelf?
       Is this changing your workflow, like checking in all material twice before shelving?
       It has been reported that multiple libraries in the area are dealing with a c/in issue. There is an interest in discovering if this widespread and possibly more than human error.


#. Cancelling a hold when in transit (ATCHISON)

    ..
      We had several items that had been in transit from Basehor since last September. One item ended up at the Atchison County Library in Missouri. Cindy cancelled the other two and called Basehor. They did a shelf check and the books were not there. The issue is how does the owning library know the item has gone missing if the other library doesn't call?

#. Circulation/fees/request rules report fixes

      comment

#. Weeding tools from Collection Development 2.0 with Gail Santy
