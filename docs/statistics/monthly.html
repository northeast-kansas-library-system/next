<p>The Next Search Catalog Coordinator endeavors to publish statistics for the prior month by the 5th workday of each month.</p>
<p>The data to generate these spreadsheets are collected monthly and saved in spreadsheets to make the data more accurate.  Because we purge older data from our system regularly, it is very difficult to gather data reliably and accurately once the data gets older.  Since we purge some data when it is more than 13 months old (in an effort to keep the database size as small as possible - which improves the speed of the system) for some questions, it is impossible to gather the data to answer those questions after 13 months have passed.  By gathering data into spreadsheets regularly, data can be saved outside of the dynamic MYSQL database in the system.</p>
