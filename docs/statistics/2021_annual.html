<p><img alt="Image coming soon" src="../_images/default.png" /></p>
<p>This spreadsheet answers the following questions for the annual state statistical survey:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Question 2.2a - Number of users</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data comes from the “Monthly statistics” spreadsheet “YTD totals tab” - column U.</li>
<li>Patrons whose accounts had been expired for more than 3 years and had no issues that would have prevented their accounts from being automatically deleted, were automatically deleted several times in 2021.  This fulfills the “Inactive patron accounts should have been purged within the past three (3) years” note added to that question.</li>
<li>The report that gathers this data counts the number of patrons in the borrowers table in the system on January 1, 2022.</li>
<li>This year, the report was generated automatically between midnight and 2:00 a.m. on January 1, 2022.</li>
</ul>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Question 9.1a - books owned at start of 2021</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data gathered from Report 2867.</li>
<li>This report counts items in the items table based on item type and collection code that were in the database on January 1, 2022.</li>
<li>This report has changed dramatically since last year due to changes in item types and in collection codes.  In the past many items were counted twice due to problems with the report.</li>
<li>This year, the report was generated automatically between midnight and 2:00 a.m. on January 1, 2022.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<li>Question 9.1b - books added during 2021</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data gathered from Report 2868.</li>
<li>The “BOOKS_A” column of this report counts items in the items and deleted items tables based on item type and collection code where the item’s dateaccessioned field shows 2021 as the year.  By counting items in the deleted items table, this report takes into account items that may have been added and deleted during 2021 (i.e. if a book was added in January, was then checked out and kept long overdue, was later marked lost, and was eventually deleted in June, that book will still be counted as being added in 2021).</li>
<li>This report has changed dramatically since last year due to changes in item types and in collection codes.  In the past many items were counted twice due to problems with the report.</li>

<li>This report has changed dramatically since last year due to changes in item types and in collection codes.  In the past many items were counted twice due to problems with the report.</li>

</ol>

<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data gathered from Report 2868.</li>
<li>The “AUDIO_T” column of this report counts items in the items table by item type (if the item is one of the audiobook item types) or by collection code (if the item type is not an audiobook item type but the collection code is one of the audiobook collection codes).</li>
<li>This report has changed dramatically since last year due to changes in item types and in collection codes.  In the past many items were counted twice due to problems with the report.</li>

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data gathered from Report   2868.</li>

<li>Question 11.4 - circulation of “Other physical items”</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>New question for 2021.  Since this question is new, there is no data from 2021 to answer the question accurately.</li>
<li>The goal here appears to be to separate content from what we’ve been doing in the past (i.e. “Print materials” vs. “Non-print materials” vs. “Electronic material”) by adding a new category for physical materials that could best be described as “Realia.”  In other words, Cake pans; tools; bicycles; WiFi hotspots; etc. – physical materials where the item <em>is</em> the content rather than a book or a DVD where the item <em>contains</em> the content.</li>
<li>Steps will be taken to answer this question for 2022</li>
