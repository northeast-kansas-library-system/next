<p>This spreadsheet answers the following questions for the annual state statistical survey:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Question 2.2a - Number of users</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data comes from the “Monthly statistics” spreadsheet “YTD totals tab” - column Q.</li>
<li>Patrons whose accounts had been expired for more than 3 years and had no issues that would have prevented their accounts from being automatically deleted, were automatically deleted twice in 2020.  This fulfills the “Inactive patron accounts should have been purged within the past three (3) years” note added to that question.</li>
<li>The report that gathers this data counts the number of patrons in the borrowers table in the system on January 1, 2021.</li>
<li>This year, the report was generated automatically between midnight and 2:00 a.m. on January 1, 2021.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Question 9.1a - books owned at start of 2020</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data gathered from Report 2867.</li>
<li>This report counts items in the items table based on item type and collection code that were in the database on January 1, 2021.</li>

<li>Question 9.1b - books added during 2020</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Data gathered from Report 2868.</li>
<li>The “BOOKS_A” column of this report counts items in the items and deleted items tables based on item type and collection code where the item’s dateaccessioned field shows 2020 as the year.  By counting items in the deleted items table, this report takes into account items that may have been added and deleted during 2020 (i.e. if a book was added in January, was then checked out and kept long overdue, was later marked lost, and was eventually deleted in June, that book will still be counted as being added in 2020).</li>
<li>This year, the report was generated automatically between midnight and 2:00 a.m. on January 1, 2021.</li>
