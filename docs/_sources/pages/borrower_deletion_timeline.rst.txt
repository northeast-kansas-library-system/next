Sample timeline for borrower deletion
=====================================

The time between an account's expiration date and the date the account is deleted from the system is a minimum of 1170 days.

It is not uncommon for a borrower to create an account, check out and return one or two items, and never use the library again.

This is a sample timeline for an account that is created and *never* renewed.

- May 1, 2015 - Borrower gets a new card at a library - expiration date on the card = May 1, 2016
- April 1, 2016 - Borrower gets an e-mail saying "Your card will expire in 30 days"
- May 1, 2016 - The account expires
- May 1, 2018 - An "Expiration" attribute is added to the account saying it's been expired for more than 2 years
- May 1, 2019 - An "Expiration" attribute is added to the account saying it's been expired for more than 3 years
    - If the account has $0.00 in fees or credits; no items checked out; no unfilled requests; and no guarantees, the flag will indicate that the account will be deleted on July 15
    - If the account has any fees or credits; or it has items checked out; or it has unfilled requests; or it has guarantees, the flag will indicate that the account cannot be deleted automatically
- After July 15, 2019 - The account will be deleted

In this scenario, the time between the account's creation and deletion is 1536 days - 4 years, 2 months, 15 days.  1170 of those days happen after the account expiration date has passed. The process for deleting long expired accounts is not automatic.  By policy it is supposed to happen at least twice per year.

In this scenario, if the account is renewed or the account expiration date is updated at any point between May 1, 2015 and July 14, 2019, and the "Expiration" attribute is removed the account will not be deleted.

Special note
------------

During the COVID-19 pandemic, all 2020 account expiration dates were moved 1 year into the future.  As of August, 2021, there are fewer than 1000 accounts with expiration dates in 2020 (and these are mostly Highland Community College students whose accounts are updated with a new expiration date at the beginning of each semester - the others are mostly pandemic related self-registered accounts which were only offered during the pandemic).
