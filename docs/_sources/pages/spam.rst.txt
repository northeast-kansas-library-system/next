Frequently asked question

Q: Is there a report I can use to get all of the e-mail addresses for the borrowers at my library so I can send them a mass email?

A: You can't do that - it's illegal.  According to the CAN-SPAM act of 2003, you cannot harvest the e-mails from our system and then use them to send an unsolicited e-mail to those borrowers.

A: It's also a violation of the Next Search Catalog privacy and confidentiality statement.
