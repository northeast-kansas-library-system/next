No item with barcode - best practices
=====================================

#. Scan the item again to make sure that the barcode really isn't in the catalog and it wasn't just a miss-read by the scanner
#. Run report 3282 to determine see if the item was deleted in the last 13 months
#. Run report 3009 to determine if this barcode number has been recorded in the "Description" or the "Notes" fields of a borrower's fee/payment record
#. If the item cannot be found by any of these methods,
  - If the item belongs to your library, follow your library's procedure for finding a "No item with barcode" book
  - If the item belongs to another library, send the item to its owning library
  - If you cannot determine which library owns the item, follow your library's procedures for donated items
