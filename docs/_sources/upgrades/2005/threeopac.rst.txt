Reports can be generated on star ratings - no reports have yet been written.


Purchase suggestion limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a borrower places a purchase suggestion there are now two available limts:

1. Maximum number of suggestions (Will start with a default of 100 - NEKLS will work specifically with BONNERSPGS and LEAVENWRTH to figure out a good limit)

This is a global system preference that limits borrowers to X open suggestions

2. A Maximum number of suggestions submitted in a time period (will start with a default of 30 request / 30 days - NEKLS will work specifically with BONNERSPGS and LEAVENWRTH to come up with a good setting)

If a borrower places more than the allowed purchase suggestions they will get this error message:

If a borrower places more than the allowed purchase suggestions in for a specific time frame, they will get this error message
