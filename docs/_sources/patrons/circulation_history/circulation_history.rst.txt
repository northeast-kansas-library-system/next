Circulation history in the staff client
---------------------------------------

Circulation history is retained for the previous 13 months - **unless** the borrower has disabled circulation history in the "Your privacy" tab in their account on the OPAC.

A borrower's circulation history can be found in the staff client on the "Circulation history" tab in their account.

In the staff client you can see the borrower's "Privacy" setting on the details page in their account but staff **cannot** change a borrower's privacy setting.  Borrowers can only change their privacy setting in the OPAC.
