6. Item type change plan
 - Timeline
 - TV item type is live now
   - Rules match your library's existing rules for the "VIDEO" (item type code = NVIDEO) item type
   - If you want different rules, you have to tell me
   - Bulk changes will happen to anything with a "TV Series" collection code (CCODE = TVSERIES) on a library-by-library basis starting



8. 942$c, 942$e, 942$h
 - Will become mandatory fields when creating saving and editing bibliographic records (942$e already is)
 - This will make searching easier in Elasticsearch
 - This is one of the reasons that cleaning up item types is important

9. 2021 Meetings
 - Should we even bother to plan in-person meetings - or should we plan on Zoom only for 2021?
 - NEKLS will send a survey about dates

10. Next meeting
 - November 5, 10:00 a.m.
