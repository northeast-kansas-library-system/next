1. Announcements, news, brief items, etc.
  - Introductions
  - Additions to the agenda

2. Changes to passwords for "System login only" and "Library associate (exempt)"
  .. Any "System login only" or "Library associate (exempt)" passwords need to be 14 characters long, contain 1 capital letter, 1 small letter, and 1 numeral [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  .. This only affects passwords that are changed after January 16, 2022
  .. Directors can log in with their BRANCH_DIRECTOR account and update these passwords see `https://youtu.be/ghYELKisCik`_ or `https://northeast-kansas-library-system.github.io/next/files/2105.training/2105.directorpasswordsearch.pdf`_ for more information

3. Upgrade problem 1 - Printing problems
  .. This is a Firefox problem - not a Koha problem
  .. Fix is at this link `https://northeast-kansas-library-system.github.io/next/bugs/ff87_pop_up.html`_
  .. Greg and George can also remote in to perform this fix

4. Upgrade problem 2 - Placing multiple requests in the staff client
  .. Two libraries have reported this problem

5. Changes to item types and item type codes - ongoing
  .. IMLS wants separate statistics for realia at the end of the year
  .. The easiest way to incorporate this change is by altering item type codes - some item type names also changed

6. Changes to item types - bibliographic frameworks
  .. The list of available item types on the bibliographic frameworks has also changed
  .. "Temporary" item types were removed

7. Best practice - What to do when an item is returned with "No barcode found" message
  .. History of the problem - those darned Koha developers
  .. What's being done - koha-US is funding an enhancement that will fix the problem
  .. What to do in the meantime
    .. Double check to make sure the item really is "No barcode found"
    .. Run report 3009 - this report has been substantially updated
    .. Does your library policy say anything on the subject?

8. New feature to be turned on after configuration - Hold waiting reminder
  .. Koha can now send a "You still have a hold waiting" message X days after the item has been put on the hold shelf
  .. Follows the same sending rules as the "Hold arrived" notices


9. Next meetings in 2022
