#. What should the best practices be for claims returned items (OTTAWA)

    - Specifically OTTAWA wanted to know about what to do when a different library marks one of your items as "Claims returned."
    - `Interlibrary Loan Code for the United States <http://www.ala.org/rusa/guidelines/interlibrary>`_
      - Basically says that if you send something to another library and they don't return it, you can bill them for the replacement cost of the item.
    - Report 2915

#. Discussion of patrons reporting claims returned (LEAVENWRTH)

    - LEAVENWRTH believes that they are experiencing an increase in finding things on the shelves that were not checked in
    - The question is "Is this human error, a software glitch, or something else."
    - Is anyone interested in trying to study this phenomenon?  It would be best if 3-4 libraries would take part.  The study would probably take 1 year - possibly 2.

    ..
      Are libraries experiencing an uptick in how often patrons are reporting material not c/in, even after quarantine is completed, and the item is found on the libraryâ€™s shelf?
       Is this changing your workflow, like checking in all material twice before shelving?
       It has been reported that multiple libraries in the area are dealing with a c/in issue. There is an interest in discovering if this widespread and possibly more than human error.


#. Cancelling a hold when in transit (ATCHISON)

    ..
      We had several items that had been in transit from Basehor since last September. One item ended up at the Atchison County Library in Missouri. Cindy cancelled the other two and called Basehor. They did a shelf check and the books were not there. The issue is how does the owning library know the item has gone missing if the other library doesn't call?

#. Circulation/fees/request rules report fixes

    - Due to major changes in how Koha manages circulation rules, report 3340 is irreparably damaged
    - Report 3486, 3487, and 3488 are the replacements
      - 3486 covers checkouts and renewals
      - 3487 covers late fees and "suspensions"
      - 3488 covers requests and some miscellaneous rules
      - Future reports will cover

#. Weeding tools from Collection Development 2.0 with Gail Santy
